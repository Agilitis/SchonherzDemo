## Schonherz Demo

I was asked to solve the problem in any way I can, so despite the fact that you are offerin a JAVA job I created the website in ASP.NET Core, because this was the fastest for me, and I am familiar with the environment.

I would be happy if I had the chance to talk with you in person and see if I should start to learn your stack so we could work together.
